# Block 30 - Book Buddy

a repository for my Block30 Book Buddy careersim which focused on building a website with React JS. 

In this repository, you can find codes to a website called Book Buddy, a book library website where user can view list of books fetched from a provided API, see details of each single book, sign up as an authorized member, login as an authorized member of the site, and renting/returning books for authorized member.
